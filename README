This is a simple chat application.

Building software
=================

Ch@t needs meson to be compiled. In a modern Fedora system:

	sudo dnf install meson

will install the tools needed. First of all you need to run:

	meson build
	cd build
	ninja

This comannds will build the source code and place the binaries inside the
build directory, creating server and client.
